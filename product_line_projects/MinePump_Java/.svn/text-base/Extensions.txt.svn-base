Classens MinePump contains an additional Feature NormalWaterSensor (senses between low and high)
In his implementation the Feature has no code.

Possible implementation:

	use the normal watersensor to guide the pump if high and low are disabled.
	If no watersensor is enabled the pump can only be controlled manually (with the commands)
	
	if (!low.enabled && normalSensorIsDry) pump.disable
	else if (!high.enabled && !normalSensorIsDry) pump.enable
