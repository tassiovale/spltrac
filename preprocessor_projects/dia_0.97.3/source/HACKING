Feel free to hack away at dia, but you're advised to contact
the dia maintainers and/or the mailing list if you do any
larger work --- this is in everyone's interest so that work is
not duplicated.

For more information on the authors, maintainers, etc., of dia,
please see the file AUTHORS (dynamically generated).

Visit the dia webpage at http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/
for more information on the dia mailing list and many other
dia-related things.

Hacking notes:

If you need to alter the list of contributors, documentors,
etc., the authoritative list is in app/authors.h.
